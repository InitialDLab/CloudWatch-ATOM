## How to build ATOM.
Recommend using Eclipse to compile and run.

####./AnomalyDetector/src:
This folder contains all the source code. You could either build it as a java application to run on a single machine ("main" function in AtomDemoFrame1.java); or build it as a Java applet (in AtomApplet.java) so you could view it in a web page.
####./AnomalyDetector/lib:
This folder contains the jar files you need to build this project. You could of course download these through web, however it's not guaranteed that the new versions would work with our code.
####./AnomalyDetector/html:
This folder contains an html file that could wrap up you Atom applet jar file and show it through web page. You probably want to modify some of the file names and locations inside - according to your own setup.
####./AnomalyDetector/data:
This folder contains a sample data matrix that you could try yourself. Try to modify some value and see if ATOM could detect.
